# WHAT IS ARIADNE?
ARIADNE is a web app that helps you untangle complicated problems by transforming the chore of list writing into a more introspective activity.

# WHO IS ARIADNE (what's in the name?)
In Greek mythology, Ariadne is the princess that helped Theseus navigate an evil King's maze, slay a minotaur, and win the prize.  She did so by giving Theseus a ball of yarn that he could use to track his way out of the maze...  A lot of times, projects can FEEL like epic mazes where every obstacle is a monster waiting to gobble you up.  Ariadne (The Web App) helps you get out alive.

# WHO IS IT FOR?
Anyone that has a problem (or project) with multiple steps.  Since the human mind can typically keep about 7 things max in working memory, Ariadne is more useful for endeavors that have more than 7 steps.   If you know all the tasks you need to complete, but not in what order, then Ariadne is for you.  If you know the problems you're stuck on or obstacles you face (with no idea where to begin) then Ariadne will help you get started.  Planning a large coding project?  Ariadne is for you.  Planning a novel or screenplay?  Ariadne is for you.  Planning a Sweet Sixteen?  Ariadne is for you.  Going on your dream vacation and want to maximize your time?  Ariadne is for you.  Doing a spring cleaning on a distant relative's Haunted Hoarder House?  Ariadne is for you.   

# HOW DOES IT WORK?

#                           YOU:  "So like... <i>WHEN CAN I USE USE IT?</i>"
# ARIADNE "<i>N O W.  U S E  I T  N O W ! ! !</i> also the instructions are below...
1) Visit https://github.com/AdamWeissman/ariadne-app (you're probably there right now)
2) Clone it down to your computer.  You can also FORK it first, and then clone it (depending on your purposes).
3) Open your terminal, "cd" to the "ariadne-app" root folder.
4) Type "bundle install" to run and load the required Ruby gems and dependencies.
5) Type "rake db:migrate" to create a new database from the migration tables stored under db/migrate.
6) Type "shotgun" in the root directory and Ariadne will then be accessible in your web browser.
7) SEMI-IRRELEVANT NOTE IF YOU AREN'T EDITING ANYTHING: If this isn't your first time using the program, or if you edit the HTML/CSS code etc., you will probably want to clear your browsing history before checking out visual updates.  Some of the text and backgrounds pulse/glow so your local browser will cache that stuff to save on memory; thus if you make changes to colors or other visuals, it may not grab the newest appearance.
8) That's it!  Feel free to use the program.
